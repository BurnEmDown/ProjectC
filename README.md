Due to lack of time, and issues with "Segmentation fault", we could not finish the project completely.
It is almost finished, but in the last few days we've tried to solve the "Segmentation fault" errors, and couldn't.
We deeply appreciate the time extension given to us by Michar Abimor, we did our best to produce the project the best way we could, we hope that the tester can see the effort we've put into it.
Thanks in advance.
